# Sorting-and-Searching-Benchmark
Demonstrates the use of various sorting and searching algorithms on a dynamically generated array of unsigned characters. The program measures the efficiency of each algorithm in terms of CPU time and the number of operations (comparisons, swaps, recursive calls) performed
